## Projects
### **Flavour Oscillations in the Reissner-Nordström spacetime** &#124; `Thesis` &#124; `MAY 2022`

Conducted a research investigation centered on the oscillatory behavior of neutrinos in the vicinity of a charged black hole representing a logical extension of the literature review. Derivation of the Reissner-Nordström spacetime from the Einstein-Maxwell equations. It was followed by intricate computations to determine the phase discrepancy between different neutrino flavors when two beams underwent gravitational lensing. This research contributed novel findings that align with the established scientific literature.

### **Literature Review on Neutrino Oscillations in Schwarzchild spacetime** &#124; `Report` &#124; `OCT 2022 - DEC 2022`

Compilation of key discoveries related to neutrino oscillations, encompassing existing knowledge and the outstanding inquiries yet to be resolved. Thorough review of all derivations and calculations were conducted.

### **Dark Matter and Cosmic Structure Formation** &#124; `Report` &#124; `DEC 2022`

Project on cosmological perturbation theory and its role in the formation of large scale structures.  Review of the cosmological origin of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and examining its mass constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Generated some original code.

### **Investigating the Dirac equation using Supersymetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSYQM)** &#124; `Thesis` &#124; `APR 2022`

SUSYQM of the 1+1 Dirac equation along with the derivation of the fractionalisation of charge in a topological soliton field.
